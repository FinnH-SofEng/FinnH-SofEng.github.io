        Hello World!


        My name is Finn Holland, I went to Open High School in Richmond Virginia. I enjoy gaming, music and walking. <br>
A fun fact about me is that I lived in California for 11 years before moving to Richmond VA and then coming here. <br> 
I chose software engineering because I like coding and problem solving.
