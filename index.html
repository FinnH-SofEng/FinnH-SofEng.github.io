Hello World!

        My name is Finn Holland, I went to Open High School in Richmond Virginia. I enjoy gaming, music and walking. 
A fun fact about me is that I lived in California for 11 years before moving to Richmond VA and then coming here.
I chose software engineering because I enjoy, coding, problem solving, and making money.
